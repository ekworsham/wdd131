                <p id="intro1">Introduction</p>
                <p>No landscape can achieve a complete and professional appearance, regardless of how crisp and defined the bed lines or how deep and vibrant the turf colors, if it is marred by weeds and cluttered walkways, streets, and curbs. The blower stands as a vital tool in grounds maintenance, revolutionizing the traditional push broom approach of yesteryears.</p>

                <p class="intro2">Purpose:</p>
                <p>Blowers serve two primary purposes. Firstly, they enhance curb appeal by maintaining a clean and tidy appearance through weekly blowing. Secondly, as a cultural practice, regular blowing prevents leaf accumulations in beds and thatch on turf, which can harbor plant diseases and cause root issues. It's essential to schedule blowing as the final step in property maintenance after completing all other tasks. Always ensure to pull weeds during blowing sessions.</p>

                <p id="intro3">Operating</p>
                <p>It is recommended to use blowers in pairs at all times. The exception would be for small properties or localized clean-up tasks where a single person may suffice. When blowing in pairs, it is crucial for both operators to remain in close proximity and collaborate closely as a team.
        
                Teamwork ensures efficient debris movement with overlapping to prevent any residue. Debris accumulates in designated areas away from traffic until all blowing is done, after which piles are collected.
        
                The blower's air pattern, fan-shaped and projected from the extended tube, propels debris forward effectively when aimed two to three feet ahead. Adjusting the tube or body angle directs the airflow. Wind and moisture affect the pattern's effectiveness and difficulty.</p>

                <p id="intro4">Safety</p>
                <p>Operators, at all times are required to wear fluorescent safety vests, and when operating a blower, wear eye protection and ear protection.
            
                When blowing frontages and/or parkways, the use of safety cones is mandatory. A minimum of two cones must be strategically placed at curb locations. Safety cones must also be used whenever a ProScapes of Atlanta vehicle is parked in a high-traffic area.</p>
